# Introduction

- Ideally, your body "boots up" in the morning, keeps you active during the day and then winds down at night, to get you ready for sleep.

# Sleep hormones

There are 2 main hormones involved in the sleep and wake cycle: adenosine and cortisol.

- Cortisol, commonly known as a stress hormone, is supposed to spike in the morning to kickstart our system, so to speak. A short spike of cortisol early in the day is a good thing.
- The second hormone mentioned in this context is adenosine. Adenosine builds up throughout the day and creates "sleep pressure". Coffee is an adenosine suppressant.

# Sunlight exposure

The importance of sunlight in the morning and before sunset

- To fix sleep problems and correctly set your internal clock, there's nothing more important or powerful than the right kind of sunlight exposure.
- seeing low solar angle light in the evening helps your body start the winding down process to get you ready for sleep.
- Artificial light from screens and indoor lighting are too weak to do the trick.
- In the evening and at night, even a small amount of light is too much and disrupts the circadian rhythm.

## setting the circadian rhythm

1. Get outdoor, natural light exposure for 5-15 minutes in the morning, while the sun is at a low angle.
2. Get outdoor, natural light exposure for 5-15 minutes in the evening, while the sun is at a low angle.
3. Avoid artificial lights in the evening
4. Ceiling/overhead lights are more disruptive at night than light sources close to the floor.

An early exercise session can help set your internal clock and make it easier to become a morning person.

## Non-Sleep Deep Rest

- NSDP includes: Breathing practices, mindfulness and other meditation practices, Yoga nidra, self hypnosis
- There is a natural dip in energy somewhere around the early afternoon for most of us. This is the ideal time for NSDR practices.

## Supplements & Other Sleep Aids

Get the light exposure and calibration of circadian rhythm right first, then consider if any other interventions are still necessary.

- don't take melatonin for sleep.

Supplement recommendations (talk to a doctor first)

- 300-400mg of Magnesium Threonate, 30-60 minutes before sleep.
- 100-200mg of Theanine, 60 minutes before bed. Warning: this can cause vivid dreams and excess sleepiness for some people.
