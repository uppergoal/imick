# Introduction

- Ideally, your body "boots up" in the morning, keeps you active during the day and then winds down at night, to get you ready for sleep.

# Sleep hormones

There are 2 main hormones involved in the sleep and wake cycle: adenosine and cortisol.

- Cortisol, commonly known as a stress hormone, is supposed to spike in the morning to kickstart our system, so to speak. A short spike of cortisol early in the day is a good thing.
- The second hormone mentioned in this context is adenosine. Adenosine builds up throughout the day and creates "sleep pressure". Coffee is an adenosine suppressant.

# Light exposure

The importance of sunlight in the morning and before sunset

- To fix sleep problems and correctly set your internal clock, there's nothing more important or powerful than the right kind of sunlight exposure.
- seeing low solar angle light in the evening helps your body start the winding down process to get you ready for sleep.
- Artificial light from screens and indoor lighting are too weak to do the trick.
- In the evening and at night, even a small amount of light is too much and disrupts the circadian rhythm.
- Viewing the light at sunset (from outside...) helps prepping the body for sleeping.

Blue blockers don't save you at night

- You need blue light during the day. So don't wear blue blockers during that time.
- And at night, even with blue blockers, seeing intense lights will disrupt the circadian rythms

## setting the circadian rhythm

1. Get outdoor, natural light exposure for 5-15 minutes in the morning, while the sun is at a low angle.
2. Get outdoor, natural light exposure for 5-15 minutes in the evening, while the sun is at a low angle.
3. Avoid artificial lights in the evening
4. Ceiling/overhead lights are more disruptive at night than light sources close to the floor.

- Only light to the eyes matter to set circadian rythm

An early exercise session can help set your internal clock and make it easier to become a morning person.

## Non-Sleep Deep Rest & naps

Short 20 minutes naps or non-sleep deep rest protocols (e.g. yoga nidra) following an intense learning bout (whatever the learning was : intellectual, music, movement) of 90 minutes have shown to increase both the amount of information retained as well as the depth of retention.

- NSDP includes: Breathing practices, mindfulness and other meditation practices, Yoga nidra, self hypnosis
- There is a natural dip in energy somewhere around the early afternoon for most of us. This is the ideal time for NSDR practices.

## Supplements & Other Sleep Aids

Get the light exposure and calibration of circadian rhythm right first, then consider if any other interventions are still necessary.

- don't take melatonin for sleep.

Supplement recommendations (talk to a doctor first)

- 300-400mg of Magnesium Threonate, 30-60 minutes before sleep.
- 100-200mg of Theanine, 60 minutes before bed. Warning: this can cause vivid dreams and excess sleepiness for some people.

## Sleep and exercice

Litterature suggests that 30 minutes, 3 hours and 11 hours after waking-up are windows of opportunity for exercising and performance.

## Learning while sleeping

Hearing a tone or smelling an odor during learning and having that stimulus repeated during the nights significantly increases the learning rate. Tactile stimulus e.g. vibrations on the wrist should also provide similar gains in learning rate improvement.

## Body temperature

If circadian rythms are correctly tuned, the body temperature shall match daytime. And it matters a lot because body temperature triggers various things like a rise in temperature promotes ability/desire to engage in an activity (learning or physical).

If someone has not slept very well the day before and experiences a morning chill by 11am, it's because its body temperature really is low and promotes sleepiness.

## Eating

A fasting state tends to promote wakefulness (think : being active to search for foods) while a good meal tends to promote sleepiness.

Particularly, a protein-rich meal tends to promote tryptophan, therefore serotonin and therefore sleepiness (rather read : happy with current situation).
